          <p>When one door closes and another opens, it can bring a lot of promise along. Sure, you might be nervous about whatever is to come, but it's time to take stock of what you're leaving behind and then look ahead. Take a moment to ponder and think about all the things you have experienced. Tally the lessons learned and think about how you can apply them to the new and exciting things to come.
            Every day of your life is a new beginning, not just the first day of the year. You can make Daily Resolutions, not just New Year Resolutions. Any day is suitable for making them. Regard every day as the beginning of your new, better, and happier life. Start every day of the year with feelings of happiness and with the anticipation that great and wonderful things are going to happen. Regardless of your circumstances, begin every day of the year with a smile, hope and expectations. You are not cheating yourself, because this attitude, if you persevere with it, would make you a more positive and happy person.
            Every day, restate your goals and your decisions for your new, happy and successful life. At the same time, be open to new ideas and opportunities, and for ways to achieve your goals.
